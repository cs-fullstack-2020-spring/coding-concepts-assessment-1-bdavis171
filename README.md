# coding-concepts-assessment-1

> DO NOT REFER TO NOTES OR PAST CODING ASSIGNMENTS

The assessment consists of 2 parts: a coding challenge and then a code walkthough with the staff where we will ask questions about your code.

## Coding Challenge
Using *your wireframes* as a guide.
- Create an HTML page that mimics your design for you home/landing page
  - Note that text and/or images can simply be placeholders and random text
- Using CSS grid, layout the components on the page to mimic your home page design as closely as possible
  - The styling does not need to be elaborate in any way, but should position the different components
- Link a JavaScript file that will mimic the bahavior of a contact form using multiple prompts
  - Prompt for person's name
  - Prompt for person's email
  - Prompt for a contact message 
  - The user should not be able to leave any of the 3 prompts blank and your program should continue to ask for the inputs until a value has been provided for all of them
  - Each of the 3 inputs should be stored into an array
  - After all 3 inputs have been provided, display the entered items in a confirm dialog asking them to confirm they want to contact you
    - If the user selects to confirm submisson, display an alert box `thanking them` for contacting you and print the collected contact data from the array in the console
    - If the user cancels the submisson display an alert box that says `Maybe Next Time`
